	 * The integers are in the range 1..n
	 * The array has a length of n+1
	 *
	 * It follows that our array has at least one integer which appears at least twice.
	 * But it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice.
	 *
	 * Write a method which finds an integer that appears more than once in our array.
	 * (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one of them.)
	 *
	 * We're going to run this method on our new, super-hip MacBook Pro With Retina Displayâ„¢.
	 * Thing is, the damn thing came with the RAM soldered right to the motherboard, so we can't upgrade our RAM.
	 * So we need to optimize for space! => Preferably O(1)
